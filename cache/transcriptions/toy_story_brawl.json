  "text": " Browthaw! We are going to brow and beyond with a playable Buzz Light tier. Browthars is collaborating with Disney and Pixar's Toy Story. We are getting Toy Story skins, Brullet toy skins and two new Brullet. The coolest cater and rapper kid in Star Park. And the uncoolest game master who's very neat pickier about rule. Brullet-a-skins, Star-Full-skins and good random skins. So, welcome to Browthaw. You'll be able to play Buzz Light tier in Browthard. And the best of all is free! You'll only be available for a limited time. Once you unlock Buzz, he'll be at an dependency level with everything unlocked and have three different modes. Laser mode. Buzz Light tier shoots a laser that once it hits, deals burning damage over time. And for his super, he fires his laser in a large cone area and still deals damage over time. In saver mode, Buzz Light tier uses melee attacks. So, he deals great damage in a cone in front of him. With his super, it takes off dealing damage and knocking back enemy brawlers around him once he lands. Buzz Light shoots two projectiles that deal more damage to the closer to the target he is. He also uses his wings to jump higher and drops bombs during his flight. He also has a hypercharge, which doesn't affect his super, but still increases his damage, speed and defense. Buzz Light tier also comes with his own space ranger mastery track, with items you can unlock during his stay in the game. So, make sure to get them all before they are gone. He starts at zero trophies like any of Browthaw, but every trophy you collect with Buzz Light tier will count as a season trophy. Buzz Light tier will be available in any game mode but ranked. You can play him from December 12th and he'll be playable until the 4th of February. Toy Story skiing! Woody Copped, the new sheriff in Tao and there are snakes in his boots, which are his gun. Oopie baby, he is powerful like all-proofing shipping. Jesse Jesse is the most creative name ever and it's now Paolo's favorite skiing. Search Light tier, the perfect space ranger ally for Buzz. It'll be available for free in a new event we'll explain later. All the Toy Story skins except Buzz Light tier will be in the shop in December. The Brawlid days are coming and this means... Present! Everyone will get a 13 day Brawlid day freebie calendar which starts with Free Buzz Light tier on day 1. And Mega Pig is going to be replaced by Mega Tree. So, join our club because the more club wins you get, the more presents you get. You'll get tickets every day and you can use them to play Mega Tree mode. You'll be collecting presents for all these days and the whole club will open them together on the 25th of this end. From those presents you can get currencies, gems and the brand new Toy Skings. Like Pop Penny, is it a Brawl mini reference? Cuddley Kidd, he just even more annoyingly adorable. Lupi Lola for a different kind of activity. Pop up their own, a reference to the most intense toy that ever existed. The presents will also contain Oop Rooliday skins and more. Speaking of Rooliday skins, we have some recallers that will also be in the present. They are Sugarbomb Mike and Rain Berly. And two brand new ones available only in the shop, Rain Tier Boney and Jolly Jannett. So this means that the Stone Churcher who has a Boryl Day skin. The calendar and the Mega Tree Club event starts on the 12th of December and ends on the 25th. Can I get another event please? Oh, and one of the extra shades. Oh, thanks. The Pizza Planet event starts on January 2nd, where you can get a brand new Brawler and surge light here for free. There'll be a calendar as soon as the event starts, where you collect Pizza Slices. And at the end of the calendar, you'll be able to play a surge light here. You can also get more Pizza Slices from Quest and from a special lead boat that works similar to the contest game. You get tickets every day, you use them to get wings. But different to the contest, you can learn more points by winning faster, doing damage, healing, completing the objective and taking down Brawler. The points are counted for your whole team, but they will. Only get added to the leaderboard if your team wins the match. Now, you might be wondering, why do only Pizza Slices? Well, you can use this delicious currency to get prizes in the new Pizza Planet shop. Mamma mia, in this new shop, you'll find special offers, currencies, hypercharged side drops and some presents if you miss them during Brawler event. You'll even be able to get a new Brawler maple for free if you collect and save enough Pizza Slices. The Pizza Planet shop will have many different offers with different discounts that the will pick for you. But also, it will run to a freebie every day. Together with the Pizza Planet event, we are getting new game modes, a bunch of 2v2 game modes. Did you say 2v2? Yes. Like Brawler, Knockout and Gemgrab, but also two new ones, Airhockey and Special Delivery. Airhockey plays very similar to Brawler, but the buck in this case travels faster and further when you shoot it. And the goal is also slightly bigger. Score three times and new wing. As for Special Delivery, it plays like payload, but a bit simpler. There's only one track, so it'll make it easier to focus on the objective. And if you have more Brawlers on the delivery then you're born in. You can still push it. The Pizza Planet event starts on January 2nd and ends in early February. New Brawler, Mipo is a mysterious being who notes every rule of every board game and is obsessed with it. In Mipo's presence, nobody is allowed to break the rules, except Mipo themselves. Mipo's main attack fires projectiles that slightly home doors the nearest enemy. And for their super, Mipo will cheat and grow a NAT21 on a D20, which allows Mipo and the teammates to pierce through environments and broolers with their attack. Mipo will not be released with a value pack like we usually do, but we'll instead be in the Pizza Planet Shop, so I will beat it. Collect and save enough Pizza slices and you can get Mipo 4-3. And Mipo comes with a 29 gem skin, strike Mipo. Live, laugh, love, and prosper with the return of the Star-Fore skins. Heavy Kenji gets up, Lazy sword and is the brool-past skin with Mimushi Kenji and Aodai Shokenshi, Kromus in Brool-past, Moon Driller Mode is testing the theory that the moon is made of tea. Runner, Nita and their partner Bruce do commit some space crimes, but you can trust their friendship. Joy can touch his grave is so clearly the bad guy in this series. Star Horse Berry, get it? It sounds like Star Force Berry. And finally, extra terrestrial E-pool. UFO is for some reason always blurry in videos and pictures. Star Force Season starts in January. Beat me up, Danny. The good relos are back for the February brool-past season. Melody is joining the group with pop melody as the brool-past skin with red white melody and black green melody as the Kromo Berry H could play in poker. Still we playing games with your help, the shoo. By by bus, he's not gonna be a fool for you. And Wood reverse two, the only one will ever successful solo career. Hey Drew, do a kick flip. A course bro, I'm a pro skater. New brawler, Olli is a new type of brawler, a taunter, joining Star Park. Olli is a fan of old school hip-hop and rides a custom hoverboard, blasting his favorite tunes wherever he goes. His beats are so infectious, the brawlers can't help but dance when they hear them. When he uses his super, Olli dashes forward and starts blessing beats. These beats will tone enemy brawlers until his mixtape stops playing. For his main attack, Olli fires sound waves that deal damage around him. Olli is available in late December with his 29 gem skin, Olli G. More content, I mean water, please, you brawler and time skin. Romantic dynamic and cute pit boar. And a bunch of 29 gem skins. Drungu G, Galactic Gale, Maverick Crow and Roeboat and... And most importantly, World Finals Leon. In celebration of the epic world finals we had this year and to congratulate Humboldt the 2024 World Champion. And to all the teams and fans who play and watch the show, thank you for making the show the biggest ever. See you again next year. Is that oh no? Hervor Cha! Damn, what's wrong with you? Great, someone's an extra portal that gives a shield to everyone in your team. Janet, you will now be able to control her better and she can even stay still while in the air. Ash is spawned twice as many rats. If her egg will now keep spawning hatchlings until she's destroyed or decayed. Very cool. His paint area gets wider and wider. Melody, when using her hyper, she will spawn another note around her for every dance. Right, hashtag poppennygiveaway to get the poppenny skin. Free profile icon in the description below. Now you can totally adjust music and sound effects and settings. Whoa!",
