  "text": " Your question, do we have multiple options? Answer is yes. Is that a problem? Why should it be a problem? If I'm smart enough to have multiple options, you should be admiring me. You shouldn't be criticizing me. Now, is that a problem for other people? CHChristian statement of how adults are raised. What? It's multiple choice. What would that be right? It's them! It's all peoples. No, it's basically all peoples' nature. that would that be right? From non-alignment to, I think you may have called it, or somebody else called it, all alignment. So you can pick and choose alliances, but you can also pick and choose topics on Russia. For example, you're still by Russian oil. Is that OK with your counterpart from the US? Everything is your relationship is fine. You can do whatever you want, whatever you want. OK. First of all, you're sitting next to each other. No, no. First of all, delighted to be here. And I couldn't find a better set of people to be with on the stage. So thank you for whoever put us all together. Your question, do we have multiple options? Answer is yes. Is that a problem? Why should it be a problem? If I'm smart enough to have multiple options, you should be admiring me. You shouldn't be criticizing me. Now, is that a problem for other people? I don't think so. I don't think so, certainly in this case, and in that case. Because look, we try to explain what other different pools and pressures which countries have. And it's very hard to have a uni-dimensional relationship. Now, again, different countries and different relationships have different histories. If I were to look, say, between the US and Germany, it is rooted. There's an alliance nature to it. There's a certain history on which that relationship is grounded. In our case, it's very different. So I don't want you to even inadvertently give the impression that we are purely and, you know, unsentimentally transactional. We are not. You know, we get along with people. We believe in things. We share things. We agree on some things. But, you know, there are times when you're located in different places, have different levels of development, different experiences. All of that gets into it. So life is complicated. Life is differentiated. And I think it's very important today, not to reduce the entire complexity of our world into very sweeping propositions. I think that era is today behind us. So I agree very much with what Tony said, which is, good partners provide choices. Smart partners take some of those choices. But sometimes there will be choices on which you say, well, I think I'll pass up on that one. It's a very good point, which brings me to the bricks and the rise of metal powers, because that is one of the shifts that we see today. To what extent do you think that that is a challenge to the West? Or maybe that can be sort of the bridge, especially in the world where we will see continued competition between the US and China. And I'm going to ask Minister Zhe Teng, but I'd love for both of you to come. I thought maybe the bricks one you wanted the US. After you, Jack, please. But look, again, I think it's important to go back to how it began. The bricks started in an era where Western dominance was very strong. The premier gathering of the world was the G7. And you had a number of significant powers in the world. Who felt that they were not part of the G7, but maybe they also brought value to the table by sitting and discussing with others. So in a sense, you had a collection of these countries. It was originally for South Africa, join later. And if you look at it, it's a very interesting group because it's geographically as disparate as it can be. Yet it is bound by the fact that these discussions we've had over a decade and a half have been very useful for all of us. Now, like any product you tested in the market at some point, we tested it last year and asked people how many of you want to join bricks. And we got almost 30 countries who were willing to join bricks. So clearly, if 30 countries saw value in it, there must be something good we've done. So I think it's important today to make a distinction between being non-West and anti-West. I would certainly characterize India as a country, which is non-West, but which has an extremely strong relationship with Western countries getting better by that day. Not everybody else, necessarily in that grouping, might qualify for that description. But the contribution, the bricks, is made. If one looks at the G7 and how it evolved into the G20. I think in a way, those additional 13 members who came into his bigger grouping, five of them are bricks members. The fact that there was another group which was meeting regularly and discussing and debating, I think certainly was an input into the expansion of the G7, G7 into the G20. So I think we did a service to the world.",
