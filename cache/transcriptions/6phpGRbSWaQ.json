  "text": " Hey folks today is Friday December 13th, 2024. As usual my name is Jake Baldino here to talk about all the video game news. This is going on this week and clearly I'm in the dingy hotel room because I am at the game awards. Yes there is a lot to talk about with that so we're going to get right to the jump. Here I'm going to get you caught up with kind of like a greatest hits kind of highlight real. If you want a full breakdown of all the technically new game announcements and stuff like that we have another video I'll link that in the description down below. It was a pretty good night. Look the awards for Game of the Year and all that like people will argue about that endlessly but really at this point I'm just here for new game announcements. I just want something to eat and we did get a lot. The first thing is outer wilds to gameplay. This looks very much like they're continuing from outer worlds one of the bigger crazier more combat options bigger worlds and I like that the game confidently is just like hey we're there with the people who made Cotor 2. They're the people who made Fallout New Vegas so yeah. Also I did not see this coming but Cifu the people behind Cifu slow clap their new game was announced and it is not a brawler which is something that they usually stick to combat focused games. No it's a soccer slash football game called rematch. It looks really simple but also very over the top at the same time but when you see that player animations and how the gameplay works it kind of makes sense you can see the DNA here but yeah I'll open here more about this soon. Now one thing I didn't expect you know we're going to talk the return of a couple of franchises they announced kind of like a retro ninja guidance again but I really didn't expect this Turrock origins. Does this look like Turrock? I don't know it's definitely an evolution it's definitely modern feeling with the third person over the shoulder gameplay but it's very cool to hear Turrock back again I will totally give this a try. Also check this out this is from Gen Design the game developed studio with Fumitu Awaita of course behind things like Eko and Shadow of the Colossus this is their new game Project Robot. We got a very small glimpse of this not really a lot to go on other than that they showed us hey we're doing the thing that we do. A little guy climbing up a big thing very mysterious cool lonely atmosphere but also he climbed up on a mech so essentially it's the Shadow of the Colossus people making a mech game with which I think is like a banger headline I am on board for that it's probably going to take forever I mean if things like you know like the previous games indicate I don't know when we're actually going to see this but this is cool. I'm sorry I didn't have my coffee this morning this thing feels like it's designed to kill me what the f. Hey you from software people got something here a new Elden Ring game this is a standalone game called Elden Ring Night Ring this is slated I believe for 2025 and it is a multiplayer focused kind of alternate romp you see a lot of crazy stuff here new combat styles a lot different world stuff this has a lot of potential and I think Elden Ring people especially Elden Ring people with a couple of friends they want to squad up this has a lot of potential being really cool. Also speaking of multiplayer stuff hell divers omens of tyranny their expansion was announced and it's out now they showcased new enemy class vehicles weapons and it might be a good time to jump back in I really love hell divers back at launch I popped in here and there this might get me back at least if the trailer is anything to go on yeah also dispatch dispatch is a new game from telltale I guess they're still working on the wolf among us but yeah this is a new thing with Laura Bailey Aaron Paul a bunch of other famous actors in kind of like a superhero management office simulator type game this looks really cool colorful creative the art style and the vibe kind of reminds me of invincible which is very cool but I'm curious to see how much of a game this actually is like it just looked really like a show also one of the big announcements of the night was intergalactic the heretic prophecy this is the new sci-fi game from naughty dog I'm at the very least very happy that they're working on something that isn't just more last of us or more uncharted this is a new thing in a new universe and not too much to go on yet we got a little bit of a glimpse of action towards the end I'm still waiting to see a lot more from this still nonetheless a cool teaser but we also got gameplay for Borderlands 4 and this absolutely looks like more Borderlands I don't think that's a bad thing I think Borderlands fans know what they want at this point hopefully this writes the wrongs of some of the things that in the missteps they made in Borderlands 3 but the new playable characters look awesome the abilities the weapons the loot it's all here and we know at least that it's coming 2025 but something I didn't expect I've talked about this in videos this franchise and could it return one day it seems like Capcom is bringing it back on emusha the way of the sword was announced with classic I assume Sam and osuke here that's awesome I didn't expect that as a PlayStation 2 classic this is this is really nice to see not a lot of info on it yet but like Capcom has alluded they've expressed interest for a while now in bringing back classic franchises and it's nice to see this one honestly also sonic racing crossroads was announced what a confident announcement they literally just show shadow the hedgehog get into a cool car and drive away they're like that's it that's all you need to know you sonic freaks you're happy so yeah more info on that is promised soon at least we also got a deeper look at dying light the beast this is a new standalone dying light game starring Kyle crane the guy from the first game now he has some superpowers this game really appeals to me because it does look like a return to form a little bit to the original game but also apparently it's a tighter more focused experience and they're not going for just like an endless open world thing also I was really happy to see like a full trailer for mafia the old country this was previously announced but we didn't really know too much about it and now we got a little bit more of a glimpse and it's kind of what I expected it's a young character in Italy in the early 1900s getting into the world of organized crime you got old-time cars you got horses old-timey guns action but also a really tense kind of eerie atmosphere I think they're going for some interesting things with the characters and power dynamics hmm I can't wait as a godfather part to fanboy this game is really gonna scratch my edge I really hope they nail it now next up this episode's brought to you by novia check this out the way it spins the cool hover effect so if you don't know and I've talked about this on my channel before novium creates innovative unique and stylishly designed products all around just kind of encouraging some creativity it inspiring you a little bit what's on your desk for many months now I've had novium's hover pens by my side right at my desk and to be totally straight up and simple they're just really good high quality writing devices that look cool as out in fact the interstellar edition you see here has actually received the award of one of the best innovations of 2022 by time it's a ballpoint pen sitting at a 23.5 degree angle in a cool nod to the earth's axle tilt and like I said before I have them at my desk uh and I like it specifically as a gamer because it reminds me of something that belongs on the citadel from mass effect maybe on a corpus desk in cyberpunk either way uh these just really make for a compelling gift this holiday season you can buy anyone a regular old pen for the holidays but a gift like a quality novium pen really makes a difference so if you want to check it out you can enjoy 10% off all hover pens with free

with it being headed up by of course Hideki Kamiya and a new studio the new studio is called clovers yes you probably remember Kamiya's original studio was Clover studio now it's clovers that's incredible no real info on this new okami game other than that is a thing and I know a lot of people are really happy with this I'm just saying cool okami great but now can they bring back beautiful Joe also Joseph Farris and Hazelites new game these are the people who made it takes to a way out they're doing another awesome kind of co-op couch co-op adventure game this one is called split fiction it's two writers that get sucked up into the world of the stories that they created but like opposites of one person is like a fantasy person one person is a sci-fi person and it's got that haze light varied co-op gameplay that plays you do a story this looks incredibly ambitious from the genre changes to the gameplay changes this thing is absolutely wild I am really excited as a person who has been a fan of their games for quite some time now this one has the potential and thankfully it also just has a release date you get to buy it once and play it with another person and it's releasing March 6th 2025 and last but certainly not least you know a really interesting night good energy excitement for new games Todd Howard and Indiana Jones Harrison Ford standing on stage at the same time what a crazy moments right but one of the biggest things was a look at the next Witcher game now officially titled The Witcher 4 we knew this has been in the works for quite some time but now we got a look at one of their first like kind of good cinematic trailers setting the stage of course I would have loved to see gameplay but at the very least now we know what's up it's an older Witcher now Siri going through adventures and it's a whole sequence with their going into a village figuring things out fighting a monster and it is exactly as Witchery as you'd expect all the hallmarks are there gore tragedy blood guts potions swords monster slang I don't know I'm really hoping they nail this one we're probably gonna get some more information soon I am talking to some of the developers behind the scene so I should have some info for you soon but yeah at least some of our base questions are answered right like we were like are we going to play a Siri or creator own Witcher what's going on where's Geralt so yeah for now we have this so like I said those are some of the main highlights to get you caught up we'll be talking about more of these games soon I'll also probably dive in on my personal channel soon some of my other favorite picks up for now to get you caught up those are all the big moments from the game awards so of course before we move forward until like the next part of the show with the rest of the news I would love to know what you think about the announcements what really caught your eye what are you anticipating it's very good to know it helps for us to know so let us know but now let's move on to the rest of the news of the week all right so other than the game awards what do we got this week one big thing worth pointing out is that the whole thing we talked about a week or so ago with Sony possibly acquiring developer from software seems like it's more likely to actually be a thing now because now we have a official word from the horse's mouth Sony has confirmed that yes they have expressed intent and have communicated with from software's parent company Kata Kawa that they want to purchase or at the very least they are interested the quote is it's true that we have made an initial statement of intent we would appreciate it if you would allow us to refrain from further comment that's all we have it's a small update but I do think it's a significant one because now we have confirmation from both parties that they're talking they're talking we don't know if they're dating we don't know if they're gonna get married yet but this is of course a concerning thing that a lot of gamers are keeping their eye on more consolidation Sony owning another thing of course Sony is not interested in just buying from software for their games or for Eldon Ring or to make a blood board to or something like that they're interested in owning the whole parent company Kata Kawa of course has like big influence and and big holdings in anime and manga so yes Sony PlayStation is also coming after your anime you better look out again we don't know exactly how this is going to shake out but it's still interesting so I want to know what you guys think about the possibility of PlayStation owning from software is it all sunshine and rainbows or are you concerned uh speaking of Sony though in some cool smaller news uh the developers of Astrobot did announce quick little update one that I'm excited to get home and go play uh this is the winter update all this really is is like a winter kind of holiday themed level and these like winter themed bots not a lot but still the fact that they're just sprinkling in fun more little gifts and stuff like I I appreciate that but in terms of game updates it is worth highlighting the pretty significant the big update that came to Cyberpunk 2077 specifically because it wasn't really expected developer CD Projekt Red of course have really expressed that they're like done with Cyberpunk they're moving on they're working on the Witcher the Cyberpunk sequel whatever but we now have Cyberpunk 2077 update 2.2 this brings uh car paint jobs car customization 10 whole new cars uh more Johnny hit silverhand appearances like they they crank that up there are new photo mode options more character customization and apparently more secrets to find that's cool that's nice to see first of all I'm glad that they fixed the game but also the fact that they've continued to add cool stuff to it to just make the world the game a little bit more deeper a little bit more compelling I'm into that also for you bilatro fans they added like a bilatro quest in the game so if you're currently addicted to that card game rogue like thing like then yes there's a little bit of it inside repugged for you also suicide squad kill the justice league is wrapping up season four is going to be their final season the game is going to be updated with an offline mode to be played indefinitely and that's that's a wrap deathstroke is in it now I think so yeah there are some people who have still kind of stuck with it and checked out the seasons but that's it so I'm curious to honestly just see what happens next no need no need to beat a dead horse anymore I just wonder what the future of DC video games are and rock steady is next up though in terms of trailers and stuff you should check out the for I know we talked about a lot already but don't miss this new trailer for Donkey Kong Country returns HD it's looking like it's pretty awesome I mean this is a classic so it makes sense but also a new trailer for hyper light breaker with a release date as well it's going to be available in early access January 14th 2025 also in terms of stuff going on this week and game releases we have covered some of them the first is Marvel rivals we did it before you buy on that it's a free to play game with all the free to play trappings but also it's a fun 6v6 simple hero shooter if you were looking for something different than Overwatch and you like Marvel heroes it's a little generic but I've been having fun with it we all kind of have been so yeah also path of exile to I believe this before you by came out last week but still just giving it a shadow because it seems like people are really really loving this game also don't miss legacy of Kane sole reaver one and two remastered I've been playing this absolutely loving this remaster new character models some better visuals they didn't screw it up they also didn't change a lot of the gameplay so it's still a little clunky it's shown its age so if you're like only like a 12 year old Fortnite player you're not going like this but yes this is still the old classic sole reaver games and I'm just happy that they exist again in a modern accessible form because they were a little annoying to play on PC and yeah they look good now question of course is what remains for the future of the franchise I don't know but if you do want to check an out Shadow to no clip they do video game documentaries they just released one on the sole reaver games a lot of really fascinating behind the scenes I car archival stuff for this game like did you know that David Hader solid snake auditioned for the voice of razzio like the main character that is an actual thing you should check this out it's a really good documentary and I'm just saying Danny when you make a metal gear solid video call your boy please but that's all the gaming news from this week everything I wanted to talk about stuff we found interesting so let me know of course your picks for the game awards obviously you're probably going to have some arguments about who won the awards and stuff like that but really the announcements what trailer really caught your eye that's not necessarily what we want to hear the most for our research for videos and stuff let us know what really got your buzz in we really appreciate that but like you know other than that that's it you can find me on all the platforms blue sky twitter threads instagram youtube jake balthino just look me up if you want to yell at me directly but thank you for being here all I ask is a click on the like button you know if you feel like you got caught up on the news here we're here every friday we never miss but have a great weekend be safe i'm jake balthino pizza's on me",
