  "text": " This is the siren head. He towers over tree tops and paralyzes his victims with ear-shattering sound waves. And I'm turning him from his normal form to the most gigantic siren head you've ever seen. All that to full my friend Ethan. But first, we have to start with level one. Which is literally a stick of space, at least compared to level four. Which trust me, you have to stick around to see what I have planned because it's about to be wild. Building siren head's body was a piece of cake. But fitting the sirens in this tiny space was a nightmare. I had to use every build hack in the book. And even then, it barely fit. I ain't even lying, I almost gave up because I couldn't fit the arms in the space without using fences. Except they kept connecting. However, I had a big brain moment. It turns out, never break fences for whatever reason, don't connect to regular wood fences, allowing us to create this Mr. Tall Lanky dude. Which will be introducing to Ethan real soon. Oh, yo, what is that? Almenous fog and siren head noises. It's time to see what Ethan is up to. And surprise, surprise. Guess where we find this bear? Right next to my house, where he's building this abomination. Ha ha ha ha ha. Nearly done my epic siren head build dude, he's gonna freak out so hard when he comes back here. Oh, imagine how this looks when it's night time. Well guess what mate, I'm about to show you what siren head can truly be. What does this ominous fog does? Oh, wait. What just happened? Oh, and you know what guys, I think it's time we give him a little bit of a rick. With some sounds, right for his very little ears. We can have his underneath the house here guys. Okay, I'm destroying my own house, but this is about to make it worse. Oh, what is that noise? What is that noise? What am I hearing? No, no, no, no. Wait, the fog and are those siren sounds? Where is that coming from? Okay, even I'm kind of spooked out right now guys. I could only imagine what Ethan's thinking right now. He's on a public server and all of this is happening to him. We could go into siren head, but first I want to do a little bit of foreshadowing there guys. It means preparing for something that is about to come and the perfect command to do that. I have prepared giant footprints. Here it goes. Oh. No. Oh. This is the smallest siren head we built guys. And you're telling me this is the size of the footprint? Could you imagine what the giant siren head is going to look like? Okay, we've got to make sure Ethan doesn't see us here when we switch into creative mode. All right, now quick. No, no, no. I'm not scared of siren head. Like, I just gave her the build because I just don't like a look about it. What was that noise? Okay, and he's not looking. He's not looking. Place one right here. What was that noise? What was that? What was that? What was that? What is that? He said a footprint. That looks terrifying in the fog. Okay, it's actually kind of hard to see Ethan in the fog here. So I'm just going to go ahead and disable it so it's not getting in my way. You know what? Actually, I want to know how Ethan's feeling right now. I'll pretend I'm in my house and I'm just like walking out here. Guys, we're going to join his discord voice channel. Wait, what would even do this footprint change? Ethan, what are you doing here? Huh? Okay, you sound kind of scared, bro. Are you okay? Me? Scared? No, I'm not a little baby like you. I'm not scared of siren head. Keep me away from that thing, though. Oh, well, you know, I saw you were working on something outside my base. You know, it's a very convenient year. It's very nice. You gave me a friend, so I thought I would give you a friend in return to teach you not to mess with siren head. No, it's real. What do I do? I do like my friend, boy. Stereo and trees, what is it? So tall. You don't want to find out what happens when he screams. Wait, screams? Well, what does that mean? Whoa! It's hurting me! It's hurting me! You're run! Run! Run! These are literally sound waves of death coming. You're in there! You're I can climb on a tree's dude. This looks terrifying. Oh, there he is! Wait, he's so tall! Yo, he's getting away. We have to run. Oh my gosh. This dude running is crazy! Go, go, go, go. We need to leave. We need to leave now. Where's my base? Dead end. Dead end. Oh, Ethan. Where are you? Wait, is he trying to hide in his base? Does he not realize that sound can travel through a wall's bro? I did it. I'm free. I'm actually free. I'm alive. He can't get me in here. All right, ready? And sound waves! Ah-ha! Stupid, sorry, then. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Okay, no, no, he can still damage me. That's not good. That's really not good. No, no, he's moved over there. I can't get into the base, guys. I can walk around the side. But I'm too tall. He just moves around. Can I go around the other side? Bro! Okay, well, I could make myself smaller, but that would be really lame, and I'm pretty sure I would lose to Ethan for some other reason. So, perhaps I just make myself so big we can tear this thing to the ground. After all, that was only level one. Just imagine how much more we'll be able to do once we get to level four. Ha-ha! In order to break down Ethan's base, we need a monster. That's even bigger and stronger. So, I'd built this next creature to be twice the size of the original siren head. And while loudspeakers for literally is, is pretty powerful, I'm worried by now Ethan has already come up with a way to counter them. So, this time, I'm building a traffic light head. We're gonna do three traffic lights in one. Check that out, guys. It literally looks like a traffic light. Ha-ha-ha! What are we gonna get? Yo! Look at traffic light head, and... and... yellow light, and red light. What about green light? Ha-ha-ha! Poor Ethan. He must be so glum and gloomy or cooped up there in his base. It's probably so dark he hasn't seen any lights in days. It's time to lock in. I'ma become the strongest man on the entire server. Luckily, I prepared myself some armor and I'ma become the greatest archer known to man. Robin Hood ain't got nothing on me. I'm gonna take him down. Also, why don't I just protect myself with some ear protection device? Ladies and gentlemen, traffic light head dude. He is literally triple the size of siren head. Let's get in him, baby. It's time to rink. Some having. Ha-ha-ha! I'm joining in, it's time. Oh, Ethan. What? Yeah. It's time for yellow light! Wait, yellow light is locked. What does that mean? Why do you call it traffic light on your head? You look stupid. I can just use my bow and you bam! What? You... That just unlocked yellow light. I'm shining yellow light everywhere. What do you think this does? Ah! What did you do? No, no. Why is it? It's yellow everywhere. What did you get by? What did you use up before? Wait, what? No, no, no. You're gonna regret making your ass out of one now, boy. Okay, as long as I see my face and don't shoot him, he can't do anything. I can put out his fire as many times I want, E-Way. I'm not even worried. I have plenty of time. It's easy, W. I'm not even scared anymore. This is not working, guys. I can shoot him all I want, but he's just gonna keep putting out the fire. Unless I trick him. Oh, I have the perfect plan. Stay right there, traffic head. Traffic light head was able to change the color of the sky. So maybe we could change the color of the blocks as well. Ethan will surely shoot us if we start destroying his base and make it an ugly. That's literally his worst nightmare. And I have the perfect thing to do that. The world edit one. And I'm also just gonna turn off this fog so that we can actually see what we're doing. Oh, this is about to be too good. Hey, this is a nice house. You happy, Ethan? What if I yellow fire it? Yoooo! Dude, it literally looks like traffic light head just took a giant peepee on Ethan's castle. What? Wait, what? No, are you converting my world to yellow? This is not the slowest big mansion. What is going on? I am a giant peeing on Ethan. Okay, you know what? It's kind of gross when I say that, but it doesn't make it any less hilarious. My flaw! No, I'm gonna shoot this guy so bad. Hold on, relax. We shooting we give him more power. Just don't shoot him and we'll be okay. Oh wait, you know what? Really? We'll push him over the edge. His favorite pet fire ship. I have the perfect plan. Let's get a name tag here and make some slight adjustments here. Get turned into pee-sheep baby! Oh, I had a nice little peepee over fire ship. You know what? That sounds kind of gross when I say it out loud. Pee-sheep? Why is this guy's name pee-sheep? Oh, hi. Hi, you almost saw me. You did this! Wait, actually, I have the perfect idea. Right now he can put out the fire. But if I give myself a command block, you know when the yellow light goes guys when you're a car? You have to slow down. So that's exactly what we're gonna do to Ethan. We're gonna give him slowness and I've reckon one, three. Repeating and always active. Wait, why am I all like, for as an insticky? Are you saying I actually peeed myself? I did not pee myself! No, I'm so done with you! I'm sick of you! You're gonna die now! Always about to shoot quick, get inside! Come on, Ethan, shoot me! Shoot me! I'm going to shoot you! No, you know what? I'll force your hand! Like the face on fire! No, I can't do that owl owl. He's shooting fireballs again. By shooting, he's gonna be even more powerful than this. Okay, we're gonna put out the fire, but I'm so slow! You want me to put out a fire like this? You're too slow, you can't put it out! The only way you're gonna stop me is by shooting me. Think about it logically, Ethan. You did damage to it. That means it can die. So I just need to shoot at multiple times really fast. There he is, there he is, there he is! Stan still? Any moment now! Oh no, he's red. Oh, hey, Ethan, you made a big mistake. I was just saying that what lovely eyes you have. Do you remember Squid Games when it was like Green light, red light, green light, red light? I'm gonna give you a small chance here. Green light! I can't move my sliders! That's a bit... No! Get out of your base! Come on! Quick! Green light! You're not gonna want to be in there! I'm going, I'm going! You are? I'm leaving, I'm free! I'm free! What? Why can't I move? And now, traffic light head is perfectly free to do whatever damage she wants. Do you have to need me, B-Base? No, no, no, no, please, please, please! No, no, you know how long it took to build this! How do you think this is a nice little well? Let's get rid of that! I'm gonna see if we... Wait. Wait. Wait! Wait! Yes! Stop you! I'm gonna get my revenge! And pull out of you, baby! What? Bye, bye, sucker! Ha-ha-ha-ha! I literally can't! I can't, I'm stuck, I'm too big! I'm f-! Stop! He got away, but that's fine. That's fine! With my next build, I'm gonna make sure he can never. Ever! Escape. I have an idea for a creature that will both l-errr hear me in and then trap him down for good, which will be the perfect setup for the insane plan that I have for level 4. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I mean, Ethan loves visiting home, right? So why began building the house? Head. Not only does it have a-a-d-a-long legs to chase Ethan, but it can disguise itself as a normal house to lure dark players to their death! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You know, even that is just sending shivers down my spine. And when we arrive, I guess we gave Ethan a little bit of a welcome message on the doorbell. I-I don't really see much, which means the siren could jump me at any moment, but it's okay. I know how to diff that full now. I mean, I think I drew it across. Okay, I do not mess with this dark area. My young child is out here, abandoned in the forest with not a single other player inside. He must be desperate to find a home. And I shall provide him that comfort. What a humble abode! Such a lovely place for him to rest his little itty bitty head. And we're gonna lead him right to it. No, that was just a pig noise. Okay, bro, I'm freaking out a random thing. Well, because I've touched that before. Wait, that means civilization. Finally, I can find shelter! Because the siren heads can't take me down in shelter. They can only take me down if I'm out of shelter. I'm super vulnerable out here. Yes, it might be from one of you guys. Follow the light, Ethan. You will find somewhere that will give you rest. And by rest, I mean internal rest as in death. Ha ha ha ha! Um... Wait... Seriously? He's still not going inside. What is there to be scared of, Ethan? You know what? Outside is definitely more scary. This house looks kind of sour, okay? I don't know if I messed with that. What's that noise? What the?! Wait! So many zombies! No, back! Ha ha ha! Get him, boys! Come on, Ethan, you know you need somewhere safe to go. I'm sure this place is fine. That's a lot of zombies, okay? Let's just go inside. Stop, Mike! Suspissions! What's his going in? Okay, I'm pretty sure my mum said never go into strangers' houses and Ethan just officially made a big, old mistake. Ha ha ha ha! Yo, we can sleep here, too. Is he trying to try to sleep? Actually, that might be perfect. If he's asleep, then we can do whatever we want to househead. Alright, you know what? Sure, there are monsters outside, but I'll magically kill them. Ethan's got to think... Oh, well, they're all dead! Perfect! I can go to sleep now! Except you can't. Ding dong! Doorbell time! Ding dong! Wait, what just happened? I can barely see anything, dude. Why is that blood everywhere? No, no, no, this was not here before. Wake up, my child! No! What's happening? Are we moving? Dude, it literally ripped out the ground. Ha ha ha! I gotta join his voice channel right now. So Ethan? Yeah? Are you ready to be eaten by Siren Head? We are moving right now! How is this happening? He's taking you to your final death. I'm a water bucket. I can get out of this. I don't have to admit I'm a baby! I mean, I'm not a baby. I'm getting out of here. No way, he's gonna jump. No. I'm escaping this! Don't you dare. Don't you dare. No! Bunzai! What the hell even have to water bucket? One of the chances. Ahhh! Wait, maybe I can control him. If I like, just click somewhere here. Ah ha ha ha ha ha! I'm coming for you. Is that him? Is that him? He's right there. You know, look at my legs, dude. Oh my god, it's like a spider. How is that a Siren Head? That's a full on mansion head. Why are you riding, little boy? He couldn't escape the blood column in my comic book. And you're not going to escape Siren Head either. If you don't know what I'm talking about, here are all his guys at Elystream.store, or down below. You can grab my comic book, along with a ton of other merch before they all sell out. Seriously, guys, you want to see Ethan get pranked in that comic book, too. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's still chasing me. It's been a gonna crush me. Ethan! You messed with house head. And I'm coming for you now. Listen, nowhere to run. No, nowhere to hide. We can talk about this. Even if it's that building I built out the front of your lawn, I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry. It's coming. No, no. I want you admit that you are a scaredy cat. And Siren Head is terrifying. No, I'm not admitting it. Wait, let me cook. Yes, I'm still running. I'm still running. I'm so scared. Where are you? Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where did you go? Yes, yes, it worked. The bait and switch. The bait and switch. It worked. I knew you were. You're too big to see me. I hid behind the tree. You'll never find me. I'm pretty. Yes, I'm never gonna be scared. I can't believe we lost some guys. That means we only have one last chance to show Ethan who's bossed. Enough is enough. If you all know what I'm about to build, leave it in the comments below. And if you get it right, I'll even give you a comment a heart. Ha ha ha ha ha! It's something that Ethan isn't going to have once I am done with him. Defeating Ethan is going to require all my building skills. So I'm combining the body of siren head, the strength of traffic light head, the speed of house head, and even some speakers and cameras to top it off to create. The ultimate Titan siren head. All hail the evil red eye. Ha ha ha ha! Look at those tentacles. I can't wait for them to wrap around Ethan. And squeeze his confession of fear right out of him. Wait, guys, I got Titan's speaker head, traffic light, sirens, and house. But these are all bigger items than before. This is every single one but upgraded. My brother in Christ, this whole time, I was building ultimate Titan siren head. And Ethan, you were building this massive fortress. Welcome to my castle, I am the King of the world. Yap yap yap. What keep yapin' bro? Too bad it is no match. For me, it's time to break the sound barrier. Ha ha ha! Leave it alone! Wait, it just took so much damage. So your defenses appear to be down. And now that they are down, I want to walk this eye beam does. Yap! Oh my! Yap yap yap! Broom! Broom! Broom! Broom! Oh, I know you're in there. Wait, he looks like a spider. Look like a combination of all the other sirens head. I think it's time you better leave that castle, bro. Because the castle's going down. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Just don't look down at the trees and you aren't see me. Yeah, just stay looking out there. Ow! Ow! Ow! Leave me alone! What is this? Uh, why is there this creepy house? You're in my house now, boy. I can trap you in my house all I like, buddy. Why there's so many houses? No, please let me escape! No, I'm gonna leave! And match defeat or I'll raise you now! No, okay, I'll look. I admit it. Okay, yes, I'm scared of siren it. I'm sorry for making fun of you. I mean, scared of it. I don't want to be trapped in here forever. Please, please! Ha ha ha. Everybody, clip that. Ethan's a baby.",
