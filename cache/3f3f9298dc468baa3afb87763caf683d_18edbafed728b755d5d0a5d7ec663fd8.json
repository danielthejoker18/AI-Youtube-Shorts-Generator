  "text": "This is the siren head, he towers over tree tops and paralyzes his victims with ear-shattering sound waves.  And I'm turning him from his normal form to the most gigantic siren head you've ever seen.  All that to full my friend Ethan.  But first, we have to start with level 1, which is literally a stick of space, at least compared to level 4.  Which trust me, you have to stick around to see what I have planned because it's about to be wild.  Building siren head's body was a piece of cake.  But fitting the sirens in this tiny space was a nightmare.  I had to use every build hack in the book, and even then it barely fit.  I ain't even lying, I almost gave up because I couldn't fit the arms in the space without using fences.  Except they kept connecting.  However, I had a big brain moment.  It turns out, never break fences, for whatever reason, don't connect to regular wood fences,  allowing us to create this Mr. Total Lanky Dude, which we'll be introducing to Ethan real soon.  Oh, what is that?  A ominous fog and siren head noises.  Oh, it's time to see what Ethan is up to.  And surprise, surprise, guess where we find this Bayer?  Right next to my house, where he's building this Obamination.  Nearly done, my epic siren head build dude Iwa.  He's gonna freak out so hard when he comes back here.  Oh, imagine how this looks when it's night time.  Well, guess what mate, I'm about to show you what siren head can truly do.  I wonder what this ominous fog does.  Oh, wait, what just happened?  And you know what guys, I think it's time we give him a little bit of a  with some sounds, right?  For his very little ears, we can hide this underneath the house here, guys.  Okay, I'm destroying my own house, but this is about to make it worse.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wait, where's that noise?  Ah, where's that noise?  Where am I hearing?  No, no, no, no.  Wait, the fog and are those siren sounds?  Where is that coming from?  Okay, even I'm kind of spooked out right now, guys.  I could only imagine what Ethan's thinking right now.  He's on a public server and all of this is happening to him.  We could go into siren head, but first I want to do a little bit of foreshadowing there, guys.  It means preparing for something that is about to come  and the perfect command to do that.  I have prepared giant footprints.  Here it goes.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  This was the smallest siren head we built, guys.  And you're telling me this is the size of the footprint?  Could you imagine what the giant siren head is going to look like?  Okay, we've got to make sure Ethan doesn't see us here  when we switch into creative mode.  All right, now, quick.  No, no, no, I'm not scared of siren head.  Like, I'm just getting rid of the build  because I just don't like a look about it.  What was that noise?  Okay, and he's not looking.  He's not looking.  Place one right here.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What was that noise?  What was that?  Oh, um, wait, what is that?  Is that a footprint?  That looks terrifying in the fog.  Okay, it's actually kind of hard to see Ethan in the fog here.  So I'm just going to go ahead and disable it  so it's not getting in my way.  You know what, actually, I want to know how Ethan's feeling right now.  I'll pretend I'm in my house  and I'm just like walking out here, guys.  We're going to join his Discord voice channel.  Wait, what would even do this footprint change?  Ethan, what are you doing here?  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  Okay, you sound kind of scared, bro.  Are you okay?  Me?  Scared?  No, I'm not a little baby like you.  I'm not scared of siren head,  keep me away from that thing, though.  Oh, well, you know, I saw you were working on  something outside my base.  You know, it's very convenient here.  It's very nice.  You gave me a friend.  So I thought I would give you a friend in return  to teach you not to mess with siren head.  Ah, no, it's real!  What do I do?  I do like my friend, boy.  Stephen, what is this?  It's so tall.  You don't want to find out what happens when he screams.  Wait, screams?  What does that mean?  Ah!  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  It's hurting me!  It's hurting me!  No, run, run!  These are literally sound waves of death coming.  You're Ethan!  Yo, I can climb on a tree's dude.  This looks terrifying.  Ah, there he is!  Wait, he's so tall!  Yo, he's getting away.  We have to run.  Oh my gosh, this dude running is crazy!  Go, go, go, go!  We need to leave!  We need to leave now!  Where's my face?  Dan, Dan!  Oh, Ethan!  Where are you?  Wait, is he trying to hide in his base?  Does he not realize that San can travel through a wall's bro?  I did it.  I'm free.  I'm actually free.  I'm alive.  He can't get media.  All right, ready?  And sound waves!  Ah, stupid, sorry, Dan.  Ow, ow, ow, okay.  No, no, he can still damage me.  That's not good, that's really not good.  No, no, he's moved over there.  I can't get into the base, guys.  I can walk around the side, but I'm too tall.  He just moves around, I can't.  Can I go around the other side?  Brrrr!  Okay, well, I could make myself smaller,  but that would be really lame,  and I'm pretty sure I would lose to Ethan for some other reason.  So perhaps I just make myself so big we can tear this thing to the ground.  After all, that was only level one.  Just imagine how much more we'll be able to do once we get to level four.  In order to break down Ethan's base,  we need a monster that's even bigger and stronger.  So I built this next creature to be twice the size of the original siren head.  And while loudspeakers for literally his is pretty powerful,  I'm worried by now Ethan has already come up with a way to counter them.  So this time, I'm building a traffic light head.  We're going to do three traffic lights in one.  Check that out, guys.  It literally looks like a traffic light.  What are we going to get?  Yo, look at traffic light head and yellow light and red light.  What about green light?  Ah, poor Ethan.  He must be so glum and gloomy or cooped up there in his base.  It's probably so dark he hasn't seen any lights in days.  It's time to lock in.  I'ma become the strongest man on the entire server.  Luckily, I prepared myself some armor and I'ma become the greatest archer,  known to man Robin Hood ain't got nothing on me.  I'm going to take him down.  Also, why don't I just protect myself with some ear protection device?  Ladies and gentlemen, traffic light head dude.  He is literally triple the size of siren head.  Let's get in him, baby.  It's time to wreak some havoc.  I'm joining it.  It's time for you all right.  Wait, yellow light is locked.  What does that mean?  Why do you call it traffic light on your head?  You look stupid.  I can just use my bone.  And you bam, what?  You, that just unlocked yellow light.  I'm trying to yellow light everywhere.  What do you think this does?  Oh, what did you do?  No, no, no.  Why is it, it's yellow everywhere.  How did you get fireballs?  What did you use up before?  No, wait, no, no, no.  You're going to regret making your ass out of one now, boy.  Okay, as long as I save my base and darn suit him,  he can't do anything.  I can put out his fire as many times I want.  Ew, I'm not even worried.  I have plenty of time.  It's easy, don't we?  I'm not even scared anymore.  This is not working, guys.  I can shoot him all I want,  but he's just going to keep putting out the fire.  Unless I trick him.  Oh, I have the perfect plan.  Save right there, traffic head.  Traffic light head was able to change the color of the sky,  so maybe we could change the color of the blocks as well.  Ethan will surely shoot us if we start destroying his base  and make it an ugly.  That's literally his worst nightmare.  And I have the perfect thing to do that.  The world edit one.  And I'm also just going to turn off this fog  so that we can actually see what we're doing.  Oh, this is about to be too good.  Hey, this is a nice house.  You have here Ethan.  What if I yellow fire it?  Ew!  Dude, it literally looks like traffic light head just took a giant peepee  on Ethan's castle.  Wait, what?  No, are you converting my work to yellow?  This is not the slowest big mansion.  What is going on?  I am a giant being on Ethan.  Okay, you know what, it's kind of gross when I say it out loud  but it doesn't make it any less hilarious.  My flaw!  No, I'm going to shoot this guy so bad.  Hold on, relax.  We should and we give him more power.  Just don't shoot him and we'll be okay.  Oh wait, you know what?  Really?  We'll push him over the edge.  His favorite pet fire sheep.  I have the perfect plan.  Let's get a name tag here and make some slight adjustments here.  Get turned into pee sheep, baby!  Oh, I had a nice little peepee over fire sheep.  You know what, that sounds kind of gross when I say it out loud.  Pee sheep?  Why is this guy's name pee sheep?  Oh, hi, hi, you almost saw me.  You did this!  Wait, actually, I have the perfect idea.  Right now he can put out the fire  but if I give myself a command block,  you know when the yellow light goes guys when you're a car?  You have to slow down so that's exactly what we're going to do to Ethan.  We're going to give him slowness and I reckon  one, three, repeating and always active.  Wait, why am I all like,  frozen and sticky?  Are you saying I actually peed myself?  I did not pee myself!  No, I'm so done with you!  I'm sick of you!  You're going to die now!  Always about to shoot quick, get inside!  Come on Ethan, shoot me!  Shoot me fine.  I'm going to shoot you!  No, you know what?  I'll force your hand!  Light the face on fire!  No, I can't do that!  Ow, ow, he's shooting fireballs again!  By shooting, he's going to be even more powerful than this.  Okay, we've got to put out the fire but I'm so slow!  You want me to put out fire like this?  You're too slow, you can't put it out!  The only way you're going to stop me  is by shooting me!  Think about it logically, Ethan.  You did damage to it!  That means it can die,  so I just need to shoot it multiple times really fast!  Oh, there he is, there he is, there he is!  Stand still!  Any moment now!  Oh no, he's red.  Aw, um, hey!  Ethan, you made a big mistake.  Uh, I was just saying that, um,  what lovely eyes you have.  Do you remember Squid Games when it was like  Green light, red light, green light, red light.  Uh-huh.  I'm going to give you a small chance here.  Green light!  I can't move!  I have slowness!  That's not fair!  No!  Ah, ah, ah!  Get out of your base, come on!  Quick, green light!  You're not going to want to be in there!  I'm going, I'm going to be in there!  You are?  I'm leaving, I'm free!  Ready, I'm free!  Red light!  What?  Why can't I move?  And now,  traffic light head is perfectly free  to do whatever damage he wants.  Do you want me to be in the base?  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please, no!  No, do you know how long it took to build this?  I hope this is a nice little well.  Let's get rid of that.  Oh, mercyfully!  Wait.  Wait.  Wait!  Wait!  Yes!  Stop you!  I'm going to get my revenge and pull out of you, baby!  What?  Bye-bye, sucker!  I literally can't!  I can't, I'm stuck, I'm too big!  He got away, but that's fine.  That's fine!  With my next build,  I'm going to make sure he can never,  ever escape.  I have an idea for a creature  that will both lure him in  and then trap him down  for good, which will be the perfect setup  for the insane plan  that I have for level four.  I mean, Ethan loves visiting home, right?  So why began building the house?  Head, not only does it have age  and long legs to chase Ethan,  but it can disguise itself as a normal house  to lure dark players to their death.  You know, even that,  it's just sending shivers down my spine.  And when we arrive,  I guess we gave Ethan a little bit  of a welcome message on the doorbell.  I don't really see much,  which means the siren  had could jump me at any moment,  but it's okay.  I know how to dip that full now.  I mean,  I think I do,  but across.  Okay, I do not mess with this dark area.  My young child is out here  abandoned in the forest  with not a single other player inside.  He must be desperate to find a home  and I shall provide him that comfort.  What a humble abode,  such a lovely place  for him to rest his little itty bitty head.  And we're going to lead him right to it.  No, that was just a pig noise.  Okay, but I'm freaking out a random thing.  Well, because I've touched that before.  Wait, that means civilization.  Finally, I can find shelter.  Because the siren has gone,  take me down in shelter.  They can only take me down if I'm out of shelter.  I'm super vulnerable out here.  Yes, it must be from one of you guys.  Follow the light, Ethan.  You will find somewhere  that will give you rest.  And by rest, I mean,  internal rest,  as in death.  Ha, ha, ha.  Um,  wait.  Seriously,  he's still not going inside.  What is there to be scared of, Ethan?  You know what?  Outside is definitely more scary.  This house looks kind of sour.  Okay, I don't know if I messed with that.  What's that noise?  What the?  Wait, so many zombies.  No, back.  Get him, boys.  Come on, Ethan, you know,  you need somewhere safe to go.  I'm sure this place is fine.  That's a lot of zombies.  Big, all mistake.  Yo, we can sleep here, too.  Is he trying to try to sleep?  Actually, that might be perfect.  If he's asleep,  then we can do whatever we want to house head.  All right, you know what?  Sure, there are monsters outside,  but I'll magically kill them.  Ethan's going to think,  Oh, well, they're all dead.  Perfect.  I can go to sleep now.  Except you can't.  Ding dong, doorbell time.  Ding dong.  Wait, what just happened?  I can barely see anything, dude.  Why is that blood everywhere?  No, no, no, no, this was not here before.  Wake up my child.  What's happening?  What's happening?  Are we moving?  Dude, it literally ripped out the ground.  I got to join his voice channel right now.  So Ethan, yeah?  Are you ready to be eaten by Siren?  Wait, we are moving right now.  How is this happening?  He's taking you to your final death.  I'm a water bucket.  I can get out of this.  I don't have to admit I'm a baby.  I mean, I'm not a baby.  I'm getting out of here.  No way, he's going to jump.  No, I'm escaping this.  Don't you, Dad.  Don't you, Dad.  No, Banzai!  What the hell, he didn't even have to water bucket.  One of the chances.  Wait, maybe I can control him.  If I like, just click somewhere here.  I'm coming for you.  Is that him?  Is that him?  He's right there.  You know, look at my legs, dude.  Oh my god, it's like a spider.  How is that a Siren head?  That's a full on mansion head.  Why are you writing, little boy?  He couldn't escape the blood column in my comic book.  And you're not going to escape Siren head, either.  And if you don't know what I'm talking about,  here are all his guys at EYStream.store,  or down below, you can grab my comic book  along with a ton of other merch before they all sell out.  Seriously, guys, you want to see Ethan get pranked  in that comic book, too?  It's still chasing me.  It's being a gonna crush me.  Ethan, you messed with House Head,  and I'm coming for you now.  Oh, listen, nowhere to run.  No, nowhere to hide.  We can talk about this.  Even if it's that build I built out the front of your lawn,  I'm sorry, man.  I'm really sorry.  I just, it's coming.  No, no, I want you admit that you are a scaredy cat.  And Siren head is terrifying.  No, I'm not admitting it.  Wait, let me cook.  Yes, I'm still running.  I'm still running.  I'm so scared.  Where are you?  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Where did you go?  Yes, yes, it worked.  The bait and switch.  The bait and switch.  It worked.  You're too big to see me.  I hid behind the tree.  You'll never find me.  I'm free.  Yes, I'm never going to be scared.  Ah, I can't believe we lost some guys.  That means we only have one last chance  to show Ethan who's bossed.  Enough is enough.  If you all know what I'm about to build,  leave it in the comments below.  And if you get it right,  I'll even give you a comment a heart.  It's something that Ethan isn't going to have once I am done with him.  Defeating Ethan is going to require all my building skills.  So I'm combining the body of siren head,  the strength of traffic light head,  the speed of house head,  and even some speakers and cameras to top it off to create.  The ultimate Titan siren head.  All hail the evil red eye.  Look at those tentacles.  I can't wait for them to wrap around Ethan  and squeeze his confession of fear right out of him.  Wait, guys, I got Titan's speaker head,  traffic light, sirens, and house.  But these are all bigger items than before.  This is every single one but upgraded.  My brother in Christ, this whole time,  I was building ultimate Titan siren head.  And Ethan, you were building this massive fortress?  Welcome to my castle, I am the king of the world.  Yap, yap, yap.  Keep yapping bro, too bad, it is no match for me.  It's time to break the sound barrier.  Leave it alone.  Wait, it just took so much damage.  So your defenses appear to be down.  And now that they are down,  I'm going to walk this eye beam does.  You're all right, I'm all right.  Oh, I know you're in there.  Wait, he looks like a spider.  Look like a combination of all the other siren head.  I think it's time you better leave that castle, bro,  because the castle's going down.  Just don't look down at the trees,  and you won't see me.  Yeah, just stay looking up there.  Bye.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Leave me.  Please, leave me alone.  What is this?  Why is there this creepy house?  You're in my house now, boy.  I can trap you in my house all I like, buddy.  Why there's so many houses?  No, please, let me escape.  No, I'm going to leave.  Mitch, defeat, or I'll raise you now.  No, okay, look, I admit it.  Okay, yes, I'm scared of started.  I'm sorry if I'm making fun of you.  I mean, scared of it.  I don't want to be trapped in here forever.  Please, please.  Everybody clip that.  Ethan's a baby."
