  "text": "Browthau! We are going to brow and beyond with a playable Buzz Light tier.  Browthau's is collaborating with Disney and Pixar's Toy Story.  We are getting Toy Story skins, Brullet toy skins, and two new Brullet.  The coolest Kater and Rapper kid in Star Park.  And the uncoolest Game Master could very neat be key about rules.  Hooded-A-Skin, Starfall skins, and good Rando skins.  So, welcome to Browthau!  You'll be able to play Buzz Light tier in Browthau.  And the best of all is free!  You'll only be available for a limited time.  Once you unlock Buzz, he'll be at an dependency level with everything unlocked and have three different modes.  Buzz Light tier shoots a laser that, once it hits, deals burning damage over time.  And for his Super, he fires his laser in a large cone area and still deals damage over time.  In Silver Mode, Buzz Light tier uses melee attacks, so he deals great damage in a cone in front of him.  With his Super, he takes off dealing damage and knocking back enemy brawlers around him once he lands.  Buzz Light year shoots two projectiles that deal more damage to the closer to the target he is.  He also uses his wings to jump higher and drops bombs during his flight.  He also has a Hyper Charge, which doesn't affect his Super,  but he still increases his damage, speed, and defense.  Buzz Light tier also comes with his own Space Ranger Mastery Track,  with items you can unlock during his stay in the game.  So, make sure to get them all before they are gone.  He starts at zero trophies like any other Brawler,  but every trophy you collect with Buzz Light year will count as a season trophy.  Buzz Light tier will be available in any game mode but ranked.  You can play him from December 12th and he'll be playable until the 4th of February.  So, I started skiing.  Woody Copped, the new sheriff in Tao, and there are snakes in his boots,  which are his gun.  O.P. Baby, he is powerful, like all Braw things should be.  Jesse Jesse, our most creative name ever,  and it's now Paola's favorite skiing.  Surge Light year, the perfect Space Ranger ally for Buzz.  It'll be available for free in a new event we'll explain later.  All the Toy Story skins, except those Light Year will be in the shop in December.  The Brawler days are coming, and these means...  Guys, everyone will get our 13-day Brawler Day 3D calendar,  which starts with Free Buzz Light year on day 1.  And Megapig is going to be replaced by Megatree.  So, join a club because the more club wins, you get the more presents you get.  You'll get tickets every day, and you can use them to play Megatree mode.  You'll be collecting presents for all these days,  and the whole club will open them together on the 25th of December.  From those presents, you can get currencies, gems, and the brand new toy skins.  Like Pop Penny, is it a Brawmini reference?  Cuddley Kill, he gets even more annoyingly adorable.  Lupi Lola, for a different kind of activity.  Pop up their own, are a reference to the most intense toy that ever existed.  The presents will also contain all Brawler Day skins and more.  Speaking of Brawler Day skins, we have some recallers that will also be in the present.  They are Sugarbomb Mike and Green Berney,  and two brand new ones available only in the shop.  Green Deer Boney and Jolly Janet.  So this means that the stone church here all have Brawler Day skins.  The calendar and the Megatree Club event starts on the 12th of December and end on the 25th.  Can I get another event please?  Oh, and one of the extra shades.  Oh, thanks.  The Pizza Planet event starts on January 2nd,  where you can get a brand new Brawler and surge light tier for free.  There'll be a calendar as soon as the event starts,  where you collect pizza slices.  And at the end of the calendar, you'll be able to claim surge light tier.  You can also get more pizza slices from Quest and from a special lead boat that works  similar to the contest game.  You get tickets every day, you use them to get wings,  but different to the contest, you can learn more points by winning faster,  doing damage, healing, completing the objective and taking down Brawler.  The points are counted for your whole team, but they will.  Only get added to the leaderboard if your team wins the match.  Now, you might be wondering, why do I need pizza slices?  Well, you can use this delicious currency to get prizes in the new pizza planet shop.  Mamma mia, in this new shop, you'll find special offers, currencies,  hypercharged side drops and some presents if you miss them during Brawler event.  You'll even be able to get a new Brawler maple for free if you collect and save enough pizza slices.  The pizza planet shop will have many different offers with different discounts  that the will pick for you.  But also, it will run to a freebie every day.  Together with the pizza planet of them, we are getting new game modes,  a bunch of 2v2 game modes.  Did you say 2v2?  Yes.  Like Brawler, Knockout and Gemgrab, but also two new ones.  Airhockey and special delivery.  Airhockey plays very similar to Brawler, but the puck in this case  travels faster and further when you shoot it, and the goal is also slightly bigger.  Scar 3 times a new wing.  As for special delivery, it plays like payload, but a bit simpler.  There's only one track, so it'll make it easier to focus on the objective.  And if you have more Brawlers on the delivery than the opponent,  you can still push it.  The pizza planet event starts on January 2nd and ends in early February.  New Brawler, Mipo is a mysterious being who notes every rule of every  board game and is obsessed with it.  In Mipo's presence, nobody is allowed to break the rules, except Mipo themselves.  Mipo's main attack fires projectiles that slightly home doors the nearest enemy.  And for their super, Mipo will cheat and ruin that 21 on a D20,  which allows Mipo and their teammates to pierce through environments and  brawlers with their attack.  Mipo will not be released with a value pack like we usually do,  but we'll instead be in the pizza planet shop, so I will repeat it.  Collect and save enough pizza slices, and you can get Mipo 4-3.  And Mipo comes with a 29 gem skin, strike Mipo.  Live, laugh, love, and prosper, with the return of the Star 4 skins.  Heavy Kenji gets-  Nope!  Dose it.  Lazy sword, and it's the Brawler skin.  With the Mamiushikenji and Aodai Shokenji,  Kromus in Bulpaspa,  Moon Driller Mode is testing the theory that the moon is made of cheese.  Runner, Nita, and their partner Bruce do commit some space crimes,  but you can trust their friendship.  Joy can touch his grave,  it's so clearly the bad guy in this series.  Star Horse Berry.  Get it?  It sounds like Star Horse Berry!  And finally, extra terrestrial E-pool.  UFO is for some reason always blurry in videos and pictures.  The Star 4 season starts in January.  Beat me up, Danny.  The good Reynolds are back for the February Brawler season.  Melody is joining the group,  with pop melody as the Brawler skin,  with red white melody,  and black green melody as the Kroma Berry.  Should we play in poker?  Should we play in games of your heart, the show?  By-by-bus,  he's not gonna be a fool for you.  And Wood Rivers too.  The only one will ever successful solo career.  Hey Drew, do a kickflip.  A course, bro.  I'm a pro skater.  New Brawler.  Ollie is a new type of Brawler,  a taunter,  joining Star Park.  Ollie is a fan of old school hip-hop  and rides a custom hoverboard,  blasting his favorite tunes wherever he goes.  His beats are so infectious,  the Brawlers can't help but dance when they hear them.  When he uses his super,  Ollie dashes forward and starts blasting beats.  These beats will taunt enemy Brawlers  until his mixtape stops playing.  For his main attack,  Ollie fires sound waves that deal damage around him.  Ollie is available in late December with his 29 gem skin,  Ollie G.  More golden.  I mean, water, please.  Drew Brawler in time skin.  Romantic dynamite and Q-pid bow.  And a bunch of 29 gem skins.  Drunk Eugene, Galactic Gale,  Maverick Crowe and Robert Henning.  And most importantly,  World Finals Leon.  In celebration of the epic world finals we had this year  and to congratulate Humboldt the 2024 World Champion.  And to all the teams and fans who play and watch the show,  thank you for making the show the biggest ever.  See you again next year.  Is that all?  No!  Hyper Jar!  Man, what's wrong with you?  Great. Someone's an extra portal that gives a shield  to everyone in your team.  Janet, you will now be able to control the bell  and she can even stay still while in the air.  Ash is spawned twice as many rats.  Even her egg will now keep spawning hatchlings  until it's destroyed or decayed.  Very good.  His pain area gets wider and wider.
